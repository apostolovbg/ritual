  "background_story": "üåå SUBTERRA: A BASS MOVEMENT FROM BENEATH\n\nIn a scene that‚Äôs long needed a home for deep, pressure-driven sound, **SUBTERRA** rises ‚Äî not as a brand, but as a calling.\n\nFounded by **Moshino** and **Hydrashock**, two of Bulgaria‚Äôs most resolute low-end architects, SUBTERRA is a monthly ritual for those who feel bass not just in their chest, but in their bones.\n\nMoshino ‚Äî known for his cinematic dubstep and drum & bass textures, with support from Rinse FM and J:Kenzo ‚Äî brings over 15 years of sonic exploration rooted in atmosphere, weight, and restraint. His music is ritualistic by nature: sparse, intentional, emotional.\n\nHydrashock (Nikolay Kocev), a foundational figure in the Bulgarian dubstep scene and co-founder of the legendary **Icebox Dub** collective, has been shaping the country‚Äôs bass identity for over a decade. His sound is raw, physical, and deeply unshaken by trends.\n\nThough their paths have intertwined through the years, it was during a recent **support slot for J:Kenzo** ‚Äî where they shared the decks and opened the night ‚Äî that something clicked. Not just as collaborators, but as artists with a shared pulse and vision. The room was heavy, the subs were live, and the bond between them reemerged fully formed.\n\nSUBTERRA was born not in a meeting, but in a moment. A recognition that the **Balkan underground deserves a space where UKG, dubstep, 2step, breaks, and DnB** aren‚Äôt imported artifacts ‚Äî but living, breathing culture.\n\nThis is not a nostalgia act. It‚Äôs a **Bulgaria-rooted, UK-blooded** movement.\n\nThe name says it all: SUBTERRA ‚Äî bass from beneath. Beneath genre, beneath ego, beneath surface-level hype.\n\nCome not to be seen. Come to **feel**.",
  "a&r_manifesto": "üåë SUBTERRA: THE UNDERGROUND NEEDS A ROOT\n\nIn every city, there comes a moment when the pressure beneath the surface can no longer be ignored. A moment when the underground stops whispering and begins to speak in sub frequencies.\n\n**SUBTERRA** is that moment for Bulgaria.\n\nCo-founded by **Moshino** and **Hydrashock**, two artists whose sounds have shaped the edges of Bulgaria‚Äôs bass identity, SUBTERRA isn‚Äôt just another event ‚Äî it‚Äôs a restoration. A reclamation. A space designed not to follow a trend, but to **build a culture**.\n\nTHE FOUNDERS: SOUND SYSTEM SAGES\n\n**Moshino** is known as one of Bulgaria‚Äôs most immersive electronic storytellers ‚Äî a sonic ritualist fusing dubstep, drum & bass, and cinematic minimalism into soundtracks that feel more like myths than tracks. With 15+ years of dedication, releases supported by **Rinse FM** and **J:Kenzo**, and an unwavering commitment to texture, intention, and subweight, he represents the emotional depth of the underground.\n\n**Hydrashock (Nikolay Kocev)** stands as one of the pioneers of the Bulgarian dubstep movement. As a founding member of **Icebox Dub**, he helped carve the earliest paths for low-end culture across the country. Known for raw, boundary-breaking sets and his tireless drive for scene development, Hydrashock‚Äôs legacy is cemented in every bass bin from Sofia to Plovdiv.\n\nTheir creative connection runs deep. But it was at a recent **J:Kenzo night** ‚Äî a show where both were billed to open ‚Äî that something ignited. Not just chemistry behind the decks, but a shared **sense of urgency**. The crowd needed more. The city needed structure. The artists needed a home.\n\nSUBTERRA: WHAT IT IS\n\n**SUBTERRA** isn‚Äôt a genre night. It‚Äôs a **foundation** ‚Äî for UKG, dubstep, 2step, breaks, jungle, techno, and drum & bass to finally breathe in Bulgaria. It‚Äôs for the people who never stopped loving vinyl crackle, Reese basslines, or off-grid percussion. For those who‚Äôve only heard about FWD>>, Subloaded, or Fabric from blogs and whispers ‚Äî now is the time to live it here.\n\nBuilt with local DJs at its core, SUBTERRA is a **community**, not a clique. A ritual space, not a rave brand. Its blueprint draws from Croydon to Varna, from pirate radio to late-night field recordings. Every lineup is curated with emotional arcs in mind ‚Äî not just BPMs.\n\nWHY THE CULTURE NEEDS IT\n\nBulgaria has talent. Soul. Curiosity. But what it lacks is a **container** ‚Äî a space where taste can form, where producers can test, where sounds can evolve. SUBTERRA is that container.\n\nIt‚Äôs how we turn crowd energy into culture. Booth heat into scenes. Bass weight into belonging.\n\nA&R VISION STATEMENT\n\nSUBTERRA isn‚Äôt just programming parties ‚Äî we are **developing a scene infrastructure**:\n- A residency for local heads\n- A launchpad for regional artists\n- A landing zone for international taste-makers\n- A **sonic embassy** for UK-rooted bass culture in the Balkans\n\nWe‚Äôre not doing this to play. We‚Äôre doing this because the **underground deserves to live**.\n\nCome not for the algorithm. Come for the architecture. Come because this is how we build legacy ‚Äî in sub frequencies, in shadows, together.",
  "press_release": "SUBTERRA: BASS CULTURE BUILDS BENEATH BULGARIA\n\nBulgaria‚Äôs electronic music landscape is shifting. In the quiet after the drop, in the reverb tails of empty warehouses and smoke-drenched basements, something is beginning to rise ‚Äî **slow, intentional, and heavy**.\n\n**SUBTERRA** is the name. And if you‚Äôre tuned into the low-end frequency, it‚Äôs the one to remember.\n\nCo-founded by two pillars of Bulgaria‚Äôs underground ‚Äî **Moshino** and **Hydrashock (Nikolay Kocev)** ‚Äî SUBTERRA is far more than a new night or event series. It‚Äôs a **movement**, born from years of sonic devotion and recently reignited on the same stage, warming up for **J:Kenzo** in a packed, sweat-laced room.\n\nThat moment didn‚Äôt just cement their bond as artists ‚Äî it revealed a shared truth: **The scene needs a home.** The genres that shaped them ‚Äî UK Garage, Dubstep, Bassline, Breaks, 2step, Jungle, 140, DnB ‚Äî deserve more than isolated sets or rare lineups. They need continuity. Curation. Ritual. **SUBTERRA** is the answer.\n\nHydrashock, known for co-founding the pioneering Icebox Dub collective, has been instrumental in shaping the Bulgarian dubstep scene since the late 2000s. His imprint extends beyond DJing ‚Äî he‚Äôs curated, mentored, and carved out infrastructure for the genre to survive locally when it had no home.\n\nMoshino, meanwhile, has built an international reputation for his immersive, cinematic sets and meticulous productions ‚Äî blending deep dubstep, UKG, 140s, and DnB into genre-bending journeys. His debut album *Eternal Bonds* was championed by **J:Kenzo on Rinse FM**, earning recognition from tastemakers across Europe. His performances walk the line between hypnotic minimalism and full-throttle intensity ‚Äî ritual and rave, fused in one narrative arc.\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt hear Moshino sets,‚Äù a fan once said. ‚ÄúYou enter them.‚Äù\n\nSUBTERRA launches Autumn 2025 ‚Äî with local support, international vision, and a sound that finally has a space to live, breathe, and evolve.\n\nFollow the ritual:\n@iammoshinomusic\n@hydrashock_\n#SUBTERRABASS",
