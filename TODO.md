# Development Plan

This document outlines the remaining phases required to make the RITUAL project fully functional and ready for deployment. The plan expands on the guidelines in `AGENTS.md` and information in `pickup.json`.

## Phase 3 – Deployment Preparation
- **Containerization**: Create a Dockerfile for the Node.js backend and define a `docker-compose.yml` for local development. Ensure SQLite data is persisted via a volume.
- **Environment Management**: Introduce a `.env` file and update the code to read secrets (e.g., `JWT_SECRET`) from environment variables. Document all required variables in the README.
- **Continuous Integration**: Add a GitHub Actions workflow that installs dependencies, runs `npm test`, and builds the Docker image. Use this workflow to verify pull requests.
- **Hosting Setup**: Choose a service such as Render or Railway and configure deployment. Store configuration details in the repository documentation.

## Phase 4 – Basic Frontend
- **Framework Choice**: Start with a simple React app (Create React App or Next.js) to consume the existing API. The frontend should support registration, login, profile editing, event creation and browsing, and booking requests.
- **State Management**: Use context or a lightweight library (e.g., Zustand) for authentication state. Persist the JWT token securely in local storage.
- **Styling**: Apply a minimal UI framework such as Tailwind CSS for rapid development.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library to cover form handling and API interactions.

## Phase 5 – Feature Expansion
- **Payment and Booking Enhancements**: Integrate a payment provider (e.g., Stripe) for event tickets and artist payouts. Extend the booking flow with confirmation and cancellation endpoints.
- **Analytics**: Add basic metrics collection (page views, bookings, active users) using a service like Mixpanel.
- **User Notifications**: Implement email notifications for bookings and event updates via a provider such as SendGrid.

## Phase 6 – Advanced Functionality
- **AI Modules**: Explore the career advisor and talent curation features described in `pickup.json`. Prototype simple recommendation endpoints and gradually expand to more sophisticated ML models.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Experiment with token-based rewards and governance. Begin with a testnet implementation and document smart contract interactions.

## Phase 7 – Production Hardening
- **Security Audits**: Perform penetration testing, add 2FA support, and review compliance requirements (GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001) as referenced in `pickup.json`.
- **Scalability Review**: Plan migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL for production. Evaluate container orchestration options if the service grows.
- **Documentation**: Ensure all API endpoints and deployment steps are fully documented. Maintain examples for local and hosted environments.

## Milestones
1. **Backend Deployment** – Dockerized service running on Render/Railway with CI in place.
2. **Minimal Frontend** – React interface covering all current API features.
3. **Feature Complete Beta** – Payment, analytics, and notifications integrated.
4. **Full Platform Release** – AI modules, blockchain components, and security/compliance measures implemented.
