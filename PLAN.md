# Development Plan

This document tracks upcoming work for the RITUAL backend.

## Completed Phases
- **Phase 0** – Repository and documentation scaffold.
- **Phase 1** – Authentication and profile management.
- **Phase 2** – Event and booking endpoints with tests.
- **Phase 3** – Deployment readiness (Docker, CI, `.env` support).

## Phase 4 Goals
- Implement CORS and CSRF protection, add rate limiting, and address GDPR/CDPA
  and other regulatory compliance measures.
- Define additional features to extend the platform (e.g., notifications, searching, or metrics).
- Continue providing thorough tests for any new endpoints.
- Keep documentation and changelog updated with every release.

This plan is flexible and will evolve with project needs.
